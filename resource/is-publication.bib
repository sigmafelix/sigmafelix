  abstract = {Recent cohort studies have relied on exposure prediction models to estimate individual level air pollution concentrations because individual air pollution measurements are not available for cohort locations. For such prediction models, geographic variables related to pollution sources are important inputs. We demonstrated the computation process of geographic variables mostly recorded in 2010 at regulatory air pollution monitoring sites in South Korea. On the basis of previous studies, we finalized a list of 313 geographic variables related to air pollution sources in eight categories including traffic, demographic characteristics, land use, transportation facilities, physical geography, emissions, vegetation, and altitude. We then obtained data from different sources such as the Statistics Geographic Information Service and Korean Transport Database. After integrating all available data to a single database by matching coordinate systems and converting non-spatial data to spatial data, we computed geographic variables at 294 regulatory monitoring sites in South Korea. The data integration and variable computation were performed by using ArcGIS version 10.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). For traffic, we computed the distances to the nearest roads and the sums of road lengths within different sizes of circular buffers. In addition, we calculated the numbers of residents, households, housing buildings, companies, and employees within the buffers. The percentages of areas for different types of land use compared to total areas were calculated within the buffers. For transportation facilities and physical geography, we computed the distances to the closest public transportation depots and the boundary lines. The vegetation index and altitude were estimated at a given location by using satellite data. The summary statistics of geographic variables in Seoul across monitoring sites showed different patterns between urban background and urban roadside sites. This study provided practical knowledge on the computation process of geographic variables in South Korea, which will improve air pollution prediction models and contribute to subsequent health analyses.},

We compared the performances of four ML algorithms (support vector machine, artificial neural network, random forest, and random forest for spatial data) against two non-ML algorithms (ordinary least squares regression and spatial filtering regression). None of the ML algorithms produced residuals that had lower mean values or were less autocorrelated over space compared with the non-ML approaches. We recommend the use of random forest when a soil variable of interest is weakly autocorrelated (Moran’s I {$<$} 0.1) and spatial filtering regression when it is relatively strongly autocorrelated (Moran’s I {$>$} 0.4). Overall, this work opens the door to a more consistent selection of model algorithms through the establishment of threshold criteria for spatial autocorrelation of input variables.},

  abstract = {The limited spatial coverage of the air pollution data available from regulatory air quality monitoring networks hampers national-scale epidemiological studies of air pollution. The present study aimed to develop a national-scale exposure prediction model for estimating annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 at residences in South Korea using regulatory monitoring data for 2010. Using hourly measurements of PM10 and NO2 at 277 regulatory monitoring sites, we calculated the annual average concentrations at each site. We also computed 322 geographic variables in order to represent plausible local and regional pollution sources. Using these data, we developed universal kriging models, including three summary predictors estimated by partial least squares (PLS). The model performance was evaluated with fivefold cross-validation. In sensitivity analyses, we compared our approach with two alternative approaches, which added regional interactions and replaced the PLS predictors with up to ten selected variables. Finally, we predicted the annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 at 83,463 centroids of residential census output areas in South Korea to investigate the population exposure to these pollutants and to compare the exposure levels between monitored and unmonitored areas. The means of the annual average concentrations of PM10 and NO2 for 2010, across regulatory monitoring sites in South Korea, were 51.63 mg/m3 (SD ¼ 8.58) and 25.64 ppb (11.05), respectively. The universal kriging exposure prediction models yielded cross-validated R2s of 0.45 and 0.82 for PM10 and NO2, respectively. Compared to our model, the two alternative approaches gave consistent or worse performances. Population exposure levels in unmonitored areas were lower than in monitored areas. This is the first study that focused on developing a national-scale point wise exposure prediction approach in South Korea, which will allow national exposure assessments and epidemiological research to answer policy-related questions and to draw comparisons among different countries.},

  abstract = {In geographical literature, numerous studies have demonstrated the differences that arise if spatial autocorrelation (SAC) is incorporated into a conventional nonspatial modeling procedure, but little is known about when these differences might be magnified. This study addressed this query by conducting two sets of regression modeling for 561 variables representing housing prices, metropolitan industry, health, crime, education, and (un)employment across various parts of the United States: (1) nonspatial ordinary least squares (OLS) using a set of selected independent variables and (2) spatial regression incorporating spatial filters into the nonspatial OLS as additional independent variables. This incorporation generally improved the model outcomes through decreases in residual autocorrelation and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The degree of improvement correlated positively with the level of SAC inherent in the dependent variables. That is, strongly autocorrelated socioeconomic variables underwent greater decreases in residual autocorrelation and AIC than those variables with weaker SAC. The results imply that spatial modeling outcomes are sensitive to and potentially predictable by the level of SAC possessed by dependent variables. Therefore, the degree of SAC present in a socioeconomic variable can serve as a direct indicator of how much improvement a nonspatial OLS will experience if that SAC is properly accounted for.},

  abstract = {In the management of alien invasive plants in coastal dunes, plot-based approaches have generally been adopted: researchers establish a set of experimental (often topographically homogeneous) plots of a given size where the plants are removed, and recovery patterns are monitored for a period of time. Therefore, the literature still lacks a detailed understanding of where (i.e., under what topographic circumstances) native and invasive species are likely to recolonize after clearance of a large dunefield. In this study, we report on an unprecedented case from the Sindu dunefield in western Korea in which both native and invasive plants had been thoroughly removed to bare sand over a vast area (ca. 11.0 ha), followed by in situ exhaustive mapping of regeneration patterns throughout the entire cleared zone twelve times within four years. The results showed that, after removal, natives and invaders increased to occupy larger ({$>$} 50\%) areas than those in the pre-removal state. Furthermore, Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis revealed that these two vegetation types exhibited markedly and significantly contrasting regeneration hotspots: invasive plants expanded primarily in low-lying sites that were close to trails. These findings indicate that the recolonization of invasive species was not a spatially random process but rather concentrated along the trails through which local employees transported removed plant material, inadvertently dropping invader propagules. We conclude that removal is often costly, and if executed without a careful plan for the movement of workers, equipment, and plant debris, these efforts may even increase the extent of invasions beyond the initial state.},

We aimed to investigate the changes in spatial clusters of incidence and mortality from 1999 through 2013 by major cancer types in South Korea. Methods We applied flexible scan statistics to identify spatial clusters of cancer incidence and mortality by three 5-year periods and seven major cancer types using the counts of new cases and deaths and population in 244 districts during 1999–2013. Then, we compared the changes across three periods in the locations of primary clusters of incidence and mortality by cancer types. To explore the determinants that possibly affect cancer cluster areas, we compared geographic characteristics between clustered and non-clustered areas. Results While incidence clusters for lung, stomach, and liver cancer remained in the same areas over 15 years, mortality clusters were relocated to the areas similar to those of incidence clusters. In contrast, colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer displayed consistently different locations of clusters over time, indicating the disappearance of existing clusters and the appearance of new clusters. Cluster areas tended to show higher portions of older population, unemployment, smoking, and cancer screening compared to non-cluster areas particularly for mortality. Conclusions Our findings of diverse patterns of changes in cancer incidence and mortality clusters over 15 years can indicate the degree of effectiveness in cancer prevention and treatment depending on the area and suggest the need for area-specific applications of different cancer control programs.},

Results: Our visualization allows one to identify high concentration areas, a long-term temporal trend, and the contrast between two pollutants. The application of easy tools for user-interactive options in Tableau suggests possible easy access to the scientific knowledge of non-experts.

This association was tested using area-level nationwide population data in the U.S. Methods A nationwide study including 2,839 U.S. counties was conducted. Poor mental health was the age-adjusted average number of days within the past 30 days that adults reported poor mental health, including depression, stress, and problems with emotions, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. COVID-19 infection rates were cumulative confirmed cases between January 22 and October 7, 2020 per 100,000 people in the general population. Bayesian spatial mixed-effects regression estimated the relationship between COVID-19 infection and poor mental-health days at the county level in 2019 and change in poor mental health between 2010 and 2019, adjusted for several covariates. Results Poor mental-health days in 2019 were positively associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates (RRR=1.059, 95\% credible interval=1.003, 1.117). Change in mental health was not significantly associated with COVID-19. Conclusions Prior rates of poor mental health in a county were associated with a higher burden of COVID-19 infection. Interventions that improve well-being and strengthen mental-health systems at the community and other geographic levels are needed to address post-COVID-19 mental health problems.},

  abstract = {Missing values in spatio-temporal data presumably cause defects, such that contaminate the results of spatio-temporal analyses. However, imputation methods for spatio-temporal data considering the inherent nature of spatio-temporal dependence have been neglected. We suggest an imputation algorithm based on ensemble spatio-temporal kriging for particulate matter measurement data for the period 2010-2014 at 54 monitoring stations near the metropolitan city of Seoul, Korea. We review previous studies on imputation methods for spatio-temporal data, then shed light on the necessity of our approach. Our approach implements resampling techniques on limited spatio-temporal data for a short-term period, then aims to enhance the imputation accuracy by taking the ensemble of the imputation results of resampled sub datasets. To examine such enhancement, we apply different conditions in experiments, including the number of resampling, neighborhood ratios, and ratios of artificially generated missing values. Results show that our approach outperforms both spatio-temporal kriging with the whole dataset (1.32\textasciitilde 11.36\%) and the linear regression-based imputation algorithm (52\% in average). Our results show that the learning approach by resampling is still effective in spatiotemporal kriging in a limited environment as well as the spatio-temporal algorithm considering the inherent dependence among the data. But the considerable underperformance compared to the accuracy of the machine learning-based algorithm indicates the necessity of further examination of the effect of spatio-temporal dependence in such an algorithm.},

This study aimed to explore different approaches to estimating local effects of PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) on LBW across 235 districts in South Korea, to investigate the spatial pattern of local associations, and to examine the relationship with local socio-demographic and environmental characteristics. LBW was identified in 5,692,650 mothers from birth certificate data for 2001–2013. We estimated individual annual-average concentrations of PM10 at centroids of mothers’ residential districts by using a previously-validated prediction model. Then, we estimated district-specific odds ratios of LBW for PM10 using modified geographically weighted logistic regression. Here, we applied four approaches with different neighborhood definitions: the distance-based approach within 20- and 40-km bandwidth and the hybrid approach replacing with adjacent districts for urban districts {$<$}100 km2. In addition, we compared districtspecific socioeconomic indicators and emission estimates across three groups of districts that showed significantly positive, no, and significantly negative associations. Medians of district-specific estimates of four approaches were similar to the global estimate and between each other. However, their variability differed with some unreasonably high estimates when a small distance was applied as the neighborhood definition, although spatial pattern was generally similar among the four. The hybrid approach based on the different neighborhood definition by urban and rural areas provided stable risk estimates. Higher risk districts in rural areas were found in more socioeconomically-deprived areas, whereas urban areas showed higher risk districts when their air pollution emissions were higher. Our approach and findings will help identify high risk areas and enhance understanding of geographic determinants.},

However, the aspects of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in the residuals produced by ML models have been understudied compared to the benefit of ML, namely, reduction of prediction errors. In this study, we examined the relationship between predictive accuracy and the reduction in the residual SAC for 597 variables from 25 geographical socio-economic data sets using spatial and nonspatial cross-validation of three ML algorithms such as random forests, support vector machine, and artificial neural network (ANN) to provide an extensive empirical diagnosis—but not a definitive theory—of the relationship between SAC and ML. Our results highlighted that the ML algorithms with tuned hyperparameters yielded marginal predictive accuracy gains and the minimal decreases in residual SAC. ANN revealed lower accuracy and higher reduction in the residual SAC than others. This implies ML algorithms in geographical research in socio-economic domains would not always result in higher prediction accuracy. We suggest that ML in geographical research should be cautiously employed when the main objective is related to the residual SAC. We also showed that spatial cross-validation neither improves predictive accuracy substantially nor reduce the residual SAC effectively.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To use activity space assessments to investigate neighborhood exposures that may heighten young Black men\'s vulnerability to substance use and misuse. Methods. We surveyed young Black men in New Haven, Connecticut in 2019 on the locations (activity spaces) they traveled to in a typical week and their experiences of racism and any alcohol and cannabis use at each location. Results. A total of 112 young Black men (mean age\,=\,23.57 years; SD\,=\,3.20) identified 583 activity spaces. There was significant overlap between racism-related events and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use) at specific locations. Areas with a higher prevalence of violent crime also had a greater frequency of racism-related events and substance use. Conclusions. An activity space approach is a promising method for integrating objective and subjective experiences within neighborhood contexts to better understand the frequency and co-occurrence of racism-related stress and substance use among young Black men.

  abstract = {This study investigates the changes in physical church closings years 2013 to 2019 in New York City (NYC), Philadelphia\, and Baltimore and the association with COVID-19 infection rates. We applied Bayesian spatial binomial models to analyze confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of February 28\, 2022\, in each city at the zip code-level. A one unit increase in the number of churches closed corresponded to a 5\% higher COVID-19 infection rate\, in NYC (rate ratio = 1.05\, 95\% credible interval = 1.02–1.08\%), where the association was significant. Church closings appears to be an important indicator of neighborhood social vulnerability. Church closings should be routinely monitored as a structural determinant of community health and to advance health equity.}

  abstract = {Most studies on the mental health effect of greenspace assumed a constant effect of greenspace exposure over the entire study region. We expanded upon literature by hypothesizing spatial disparities in the effect of greenspace exposure on mental illness mortality across census tracts in Oregon (OR) and Washington (WA). Mental illness mortality was calculated using death register data with coordinates of residence over 13 years (2006-2018). Neighborhood park exposure was evaluated as the total area of parks in each census tract. Results indicated that the impact of park areas on mental illness mortality varied across census tracts in OR (Relative Risk=0.985, 95\% credible interval=[0.950\, 1.020] ‒ 1.030 [0.990\, 1.072]) and WA (0.992 [0.952\, 1.034] ‒ 1.013 [0.980\, 1.048]). These estimates shifted overall fixed effect RRs (OR: 0.976 [0.958\, 0.994]; WA: 0.976 [0.956\, 0.996]). Protective effects were more likely in areas between Olympia\, WA and Portland, OR. The urban-rural contrasts were explained by patients\' preference\, differential greenspace accessibility\, and limited park supply in national and state forests. This research highlights the disparity in greenspace effect on mental illness mortality and calls for integrating local effect variability into mental health outcomes-greenspace studies.}

abstract = {This study introduces chopin, an R package that lowers the technical barriers to parallelizing geocomputation. Supporting popular R spatial-analysis libraries, chopin exploits parallel computing by partitioning data involved in each task. Partitioning can occur with regular grids, hierarchical units, or multiple file inputs, accommodating diverse input types and ensuring interoperability. This approach scales geospatial covariate calculations to match available processing power, from laptop computers to high-performance computers, reducing execution times proportional to the number of processing units. chopin is expected to benefit a broad range of research communities working with large-scale geospatial data, providing an efficient, flexible, and accessible tool for scaling geospatial computations.}
